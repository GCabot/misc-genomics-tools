Some scripts for handling multiple VCF files

run e.g.

python ../scripts/index_multiple_vcf.py variant_files bcf_files results.pickle
python ../scripts/tabulate_multiple_vcf.py results.pickle > results.fna

Assumes there is a file called 'variant_files' which lists all the VCF files

e.g.

NC_002755_K7_ilmn_bwa.vcf
NC_002755_K7_pgm.noindel.vcf
NC_002755_K8_ilmn_bwa.vcf

And a file called bcf_files which is a list of display identifiers and BCF files (tab-separated), e.g.

K7_ilmn NC_002755_K7_ilmn_bwa.all.bcf.gz
K7_pgm  NC_002755_K7_pgm.all.bcf.gz
K8_ilmn NC_002755_K8_ilmn_bwa.all.bcf.gz
